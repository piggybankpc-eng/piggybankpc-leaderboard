# 🔧 Test File Format Fixed!

## ❌ Problem

You were getting this error when uploading the test file:
```
Failed to decode submission: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
Submission file is INVALID or TAMPERED
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The original `test_benchmark_signed.pbr` file was in **plain JSON format**, but the security system expects files to be:

1. **Base64 encoded** (to prevent manual editing)
2. **With header comments** (for version/metadata)

## ✅ Solution

Created a new properly formatted file: **`test_benchmark_encoded.pbr`**

### **File Format:**

```
# PiggyBankPC Benchmark Results
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
# Upload this file to: http://localhost:5555/submit
# Version: 1.0.0
# Timestamp: 2025-10-25T20:45:00.000Z

```

The long base64 string contains all your benchmark data encrypted and signed.
